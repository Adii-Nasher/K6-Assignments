### Assignment 1
```python
1- The task involves creating a performance test script for an API using k6, a load testing tool. The first step is to install and configure k6 on a local machine. 

2- Next, a performance test script needs to be written for an API, which can be any available dummy API i.e https://reqres.in/api/users.

3- The load profile needs to be created in a ramp-up and ramp-down fashion. This means that the number of virtual users will gradually increase to a maximum, then 
   stay at that level for a certain period of time before gradually decreasing back to zero.

4- In addition to the built-in metrics provided by k6, a new trend needs to be created that logs some sort of statistics. This can be accomplished using the `Trend` 
   function in k6.

5- Once the script has been written and the load profile configured, the script can be run using the `k6 run` command, and the results can be analyzed to identify any 
   performance issues with the API.

### Assignment 2
```python
1- The task is to add assertions and checks to a k6 test script.

2- The k6 project used in assignment 1 will be used again.

3- Valid assertions must be applied to the test script.

4- Thresholds must also be added to the script.

### Assignment 3
```python
1- The task requires the installation of the k6 and Postman plugins.

2- The Postman collection created in the previous assignment needs to be converted to a k6 script.

3- The converted script should be executed to simulate any load.

4- In addition to the execution, a k6 HTML report also needs to be generated.

5- The load simulation can be based on any desired load pattern or scenario.
